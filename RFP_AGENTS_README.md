## ðŸš€ Usage

### Running Individual Agents

```bash
# RFP Creation Agent
adk run rfp_creation

# RFP Validation Agent  
adk run rfp_validation

# RFP Orchestrator Agent
adk run rfp_orchestrator

# Original RAG Agent
adk run rag
```

### Using the Agent Registry (Programmatically)

```python
from rag.agent_registry import get_agent, list_available_agents

# List all available agents
agents = list_available_agents()
print(agents)  # ['rag', 'rfp_creation', 'rfp_validation', 'rfp_orchestrator']

# Get a specific agent
creation_agent = get_agent("rfp_creation")
validation_agent = get_agent("rfp_validation")
```

## ðŸ“‹ RFP Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Project Information
The RFP Creation Agent will ask for:
- **Project Name & Description**: Clear project title and overview
- **Scope & Objectives**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Budget Range**: Financial constraints and expectations
- **Timeline**: Project duration and key milestones
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific technical needs
- **Stakeholder Information**: Key contacts and decision makers
- **Compliance Requirements**: Any regulatory or legal requirements

### Step 2: RFP Generation
The agent will:
1. Retrieve relevant guidelines from the Digital Projects RFPs document
2. Create a comprehensive RFP with all required sections
3. Ensure compliance with guidelines
4. Provide proper formatting and structure
5. Include citations for guidelines used

### Step 3: Review and Refinement
- Review the generated RFP
- Request modifications if needed
- Ensure all requirements are met

## âœ… RFP Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Submit RFP for Validation
Provide your RFP document to the validation agent.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Analysis
The agent will:
1. Review RFP structure and completeness
2. Check compliance with guidelines
3. Identify missing requirements
4. Evaluate content quality
5. Assess technical specifications

### Step 3: Validation Report
Receive a detailed report including:
- **Overall Compliance Score** (1-10)
- **Strengths**: What the RFP does well
- **Areas for Improvement**: Specific issues found
- **Missing Requirements**: Required sections or content
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions
- **Citations**: Guidelines used for validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Interactions

### RFP Creation Example
```
User: "I want to create an RFP for a new e-commerce website"

Agent: "I can help you create a comprehensive RFP! To get started, I'll need some project details from you:
- Project name and description
- Project scope and objectives  
- Budget range
- Timeline requirements
- Technical requirements

I'll use the Digital Projects RFPs guidelines to ensure your RFP is complete and compliant. Please provide these details and I'll create a professional RFP for you."
```

### RFP Validation Example
```
User: "Please validate this RFP for compliance"

Agent: "I can help you validate your RFP against the Digital Projects RFPs guidelines! Please share your RFP document, and I'll:
- Review it for completeness and structure
- Check compliance with guidelines
- Provide a detailed validation report with recommendations
- Give you a compliance score and specific areas for improvement"
```

### Key Components
- **Vertex AI RAG Engine**: Document retrieval and search
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Language model for all agents
- **Specialized Tools**: Each agent has tailored retrieval tools
- **Agent Registry**: Centralized agent management
- **Environment Configuration**: `.env` file for settings

## ðŸ“Š Testing

Run the test suite to verify all agents are working:

```bash
python test_rfp_agents.py
```

This will:
- Test agent availability
- Verify configuration
- Demonstrate usage patterns
- Show sample interactions

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-east1
RAG_CORPUS=projects/xxx/locations/xxx/ragCorpora/xxx
```

### Corpus Setup
The system uses the Digital Projects RFPs document as the knowledge base. Ensure the corpus is properly set up by running:

```bash
python rag/shared_libraries/prepare_corpus_and_data.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### For RFP Creation
1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed project information
2. **Include Context**: Share relevant background and constraints
3. **Review Guidelines**: Let the agent retrieve and apply guidelines
4. **Iterate**: Request modifications as needed

### For RFP Validation
1. **Complete RFP**: Submit the full RFP document
